Programming Assignment 2

	This program works using a class to store and set values which
are used in the main. It accepts an input file and reads in the values
for the class to store, use, manipulate, etc. To compile, simply type
"make" as the Makefile for this will compile the program. Then, type "make run"
to run it, and "make clean" to clear all unneeded files afterwards.
One of the primary issues I had was with the calculations, as I was having
issues storing the values and resetting them, as they kept being incremented
in the calculations. Overall, this assignment was relatively difficult.
I felt a little underprepared for the assignment, but for the most part what
we covered in class and lab the week of the due date helped to make up for
and help solve the issues I was having.
